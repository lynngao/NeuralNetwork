# NeuralNetwork
Simple Neural Network for MNIST handwritten digits recognition

Two fully connected hidden layers with ReLu and softmax activation functions

First layer with 128 neurons and second with 32 layers

Batch size = 128 and number of epoches used is depend on training data size (20 is enough for most of sizes)

Achieves accuracy as high as 97%
