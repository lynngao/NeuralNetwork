# NeuralNetwork
Simple Neural Network for MNIST handwritten digits recognition

Please download data from here and follow the instructions to get training and test data: http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/gettingstarted.html

Two fully connected hidden layers with ReLu and softmax activation functions

First layer with 128 neurons and second with 32 layers

Batch size = 128 and number of epoches used is depend on training data size (20 is enough for most of sizes)

Achieves accuracy as high as 97%
